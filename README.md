# qtjsapi
QJSEngine bindings for the Qt API

This project was developed as part of the QCAD application and
replaces the Qt Script based <a href="https://github.com/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator">qtscriptgenerator</a> 
for Qt 5 which was made obsolete when the Qt Script module was declared deprecated.

Usage

QJSEngine* engine = new QJSEngine();

RJSApi* rjsapi = new RJSApi(engine);
